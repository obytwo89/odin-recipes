So in this lesson of Odin I'm supposed to gather
up all my HTML lessons up until the moment and 
ultimately test what I've learned.

Starting I'm not too concerned about the HTML,
I'm more concerned about git and the CLI then HTML.

I'll revisit once I've completed the lesson and share my thoughts.

So i finished the lesson and it wasnt too bad. Again I'm not too worried about HTML at all.

Git wasnt too bad, I learned I can stage an entire folder at once. And I will absolutely need to watch more videos on commiting within GIT.
