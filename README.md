So in this lesson of Odin I'm supposed to gather
up all my HTML lessons up until the moment and 
ultimately test what I've learned.

Starting I'm not too concerned about the HTML,
I'm more concerned about git and the CLI then HTML.

I'll revisit once I've completed the lesson and share my thoughts.
